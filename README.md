# 🚀 Full-Stack Deployment – Railway PaaS Edition

Welcome to this **full-stack web application**, deployed seamlessly using **Railway**, a modern Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) platform.  
This project consists of a **Vite React frontend** and an **Express.js backend**, deployed as two separate Railway services that talk to each other securely via environment variables and CORS.
